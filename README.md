# A Small Gesture
This repository contains code base of some technologies that I was not aware while creating this.

In nut and shell, I was doing development since years using microsoft technologies in my career but i came across something recently that got my attention to assess myself with doing a bit unknown.

So I'll be developing a samll architecture which will include some technologies that I've bit '0' hands-on experience:

AWS,
Ruby,
NodeJS,
React,
AWS deployments
